# UnsupervisedML_LDA_UMAP_K-Means_RandomForest
For this project, I used an unlabeled spotify music dataset and predicted how many genres there are. After cleaning up the messy data, I used LDA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering, then used the Random Forest method to predict how many genres are present in the dataset.
